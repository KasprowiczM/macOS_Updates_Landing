## GitHub Actions budget guardrail

This repository is owned by the `KasprowiczM` GitHub Free account. Private repositories share a hard allowance of 2,000 GitHub Actions minutes per month.

- Do not add, enable, or broaden scheduled workflows without the user's explicit approval.
- Default to `ubuntu-latest`; use macOS, Windows, or larger runners only when technically required and explicitly approved.
- Expensive platform-specific jobs should be manual or release-only, not triggered by every branch push.
- Restrict push/PR triggers by branch and path, add `concurrency` with cancellation, and set `timeout-minutes` on every job.
- Before changing Actions, estimate the monthly run count and minute impact. Do not change billing or spending limits without explicit approval.
- Public-repository standard runners may be free, but the same anti-waste rules still apply.
